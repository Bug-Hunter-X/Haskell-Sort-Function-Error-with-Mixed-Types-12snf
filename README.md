# Haskell Sort Function Error with Mixed Types

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell when using the `sort` function from `Data.List` with lists containing elements of different, non-comparable types.

The `bug.hs` file shows the error in action.  The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a solution using type-safe techniques to handle this situation.

This error highlights Haskell's strong type system, preventing runtime type errors that are common in dynamically typed languages.
